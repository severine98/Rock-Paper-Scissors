# Rock Paper Scissors
A Rock Paper Scissors game against the computer. Click on the move you wish to execute and find out if you have won or lost the round. Keep track of the scores and reset the game if you wish.

My first project using JavaScript. This was produced during the second week of the Web Development course and was a great chance to get comfortable with CSS.
